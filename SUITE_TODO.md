# Archive Suite — working to-do queue

The **near-term** to-do queue for both apps (see root `CLAUDE.md` §Docs & backlog convention). Long-term
ideas live in each app's `POTENTIAL_FEATURES.md`; detailed in-flight plans live in `execution-plans/`
(indexed below, deleted when shipped). Full-codebase review: the paced method in `REVIEW.md`. Unattended /
autonomous runs: `ops/autonomous/README.md` (durable plan → self-resume daemon), which drains this queue one
bounded item per fresh session.
Paths repo-root-relative; Reader source = `ArchiveReader/macOS/Sources/ArchiveReader/`,
Processor source = `ArchiveProcessor/macOS/Sources/ArchiveProcessor/`.

Legend — effort S/M/L · risk low/med/high · **needs:** none | gui (drive app at runtime) | owner
(account/manual) | corpus-write (safety-sensitive).

## 🎯 Project focus & ON-HOLD areas (owner, 2026-07-09)

**Focus now:** the **wired (USB) + wireless (LAN/Wi-Fi) phone↔Mac transmission** path and the **Android**
companion — plus the core Mac pipeline (OCR/tag/PDF/finalize) and the Reader, which continue as normal.

**ON HOLD — maintain-only** (keep them compiling / mirror shared-contract changes so they don't rot, but
**no new feature development, and NOT a code-review or bug-fix target**):
- **iOS companion** — `ArchiveProcessor/ArchiveCaptureiOS/`.
- **Cloud (Google Drive) relay transport** — Mac `Net/{DriveObjectStore,DriveClient,DriveAuth}.swift` + the
  `FileRelayReceiver`/`RelayObjectStore` cloud path (incl. the offline `FileRelay` stand-in); both companions'
  `DriveRelayTransport`/`DriveAuth`/`DriveClient`. The `RelayObjectFormat` wire contract stays frozen — only
  mirror it if a focused change forces it.

*Maintain-only* means: if a protocol/SPEC change on the focus path (LAN/USB, Android) requires it, mirror the
minimum into iOS/cloud so they still build — but don't invest effort or reviews there. **Code reviews + fixes
concentrate on:** LAN transport (`Net/CaptureServer.swift`, `CaptureReceiver`, non-Drive `Net/`), USB
(`Net/USBBridge.swift`), the **Android** app (`ArchiveCapture/`), and the Mac pipeline + Reader.

## Active execution plans (`execution-plans/`)
- `openai-chatgpt-provider.md` — **READY (daemon-buildable), Processor**: add OpenAI/ChatGPT as a first-class
  provider via (1) the **standard API** (native `LLMProvider.openai`, BYO OpenAI API key) and (2) an **OpenAI
  gateway preset** over the existing OpenAI-compatible gateway. Reuses `OpenAICompatibleClient` (already speaks
  OpenAI's format), so the code is build-verifiable at $0; the enum append stays append-only + opt-in. Tier-1.
  The plan now carries a **Daemon build plan** splitting it into `W13.oai-1…3` (unattended, no key) + a keyed
  live-OCR-test tail. → queued in the **Provider expansion (Wave 13)** section below.
- `local-agent-cli-provider.md` — **READY (daemon-buildable), Processor**: drive OCR/tagging through a locally
  installed, subscription-authenticated CLI — **Claude Code + Gemini CLI + OpenAI Codex CLI**, all first-class —
  for enterprise Claude / Gemini / ChatGPT(Edu) accounts with no API key. Additive `localAgent` config sibling to
  the gateway (append-only, keeps resume-critical snapshots unchanged). Tier-2, but the whole gate is satisfiable
  **unattended** via a committed fake-CLI harness ($0). The plan now carries a **Daemon build plan** splitting it
  into `W13.cli-1…4` (unattended) + a keyed/entitlement tail (gemini/codex install; real-CLI live smoke — blocked
  inside a Claude Code session by the nested-session guard). Claude path validated on-machine 2026-07-10.
  → queued in **Provider expansion (Wave 13)** below.
- ~~`archive-notes/` (00a, 01–08)~~ — **SHIPPED** (NEW APP: Archive Notes, W0–W8). The per-wave plans were
  **deleted on ship** (git history keeps them). `execution-plans/archive-notes/00-overview.md` is **RETAINED** as
  the authoritative interface contract (§2 locked decisions, §5 front-matter schema, **§16 Interface Contract**
  cited by `ArchiveNotes/CLAUDE.md`). Cleanup item: fold §16 into `ArchiveNotes/CLAUDE.md` or promote to `SPEC/`,
  then delete — see **Suite doc hygiene** below.
- ~~`index-parallelization.md`~~ — **SHIPPED** (parallel+batched index build + bm25 ranked search +
  search-during-index refresh). Plan deleted.
- ~~`index-pruning.md`~~ — **SHIPPED** (gated content-index pruning). Plan deleted.
- ~~`decades-date-facet.md`~~ — **SHIPPED** (decade date facet). Plan deleted.
- ~~`reader-smart-folders-scoped.md`~~ — **SHIPPED** (smart folders as scoped root). Plan deleted.
- ~~`reader-gui-test-harness.md`~~ — **SHIPPED** (W7.1–W7.5). XCUITest target, accessibilityIdentifiers,
  DEBUG-gated fixture-root override, `make-gui-fixture.sh`, initial test suite (navigation, tag cloud,
  viewer, preview, filter, sort, degrade). Plan deleted.

## Provider expansion — Wave 13 (Processor; daemon-buildable) — queued 2026-07-16
The two proposed provider plans, now **elaborated with a "Daemon build plan"** each so a fresh autonomous session
can build them: each sub-task below is **unattended, $0, no key, no GUI** (build clean + fake-CLI/unit tests +
self-review), with the live-key verification split out to a **keyed/owner tail** (below) that is flagged to
Morning Review, NOT skipped. Do top-to-bottom, one bounded sub-task per session. **OpenAI first (Tier-1, smaller,
reuses the existing OpenAI-format client), then CLI (Tier-2).** New provider changes stay **additive + opt-in** —
never flip the default provider until the keyed live test passes. Legend as above.

**OpenAI / ChatGPT provider** (`execution-plans/openai-chatgpt-provider.md`; Tier-1; SHARED HOTSPOT = the
persisted `LLMProvider` enum, append-only):
- [x] **W13.oai-1 — native provider wiring.** Append `case openai` to `LLMProvider` (append-only), add
  `LLMModel.openaiModels` + the model-family param adapter (`max_completion_tokens`/no-`temperature`/
  `reasoning_effort`), route `.openai` through the reused `OpenAICompatibleClient` at the ~6–8 switch sites.
  ⚠️ Model IDs + pricing = clearly-marked `// VERIFY` placeholders (a wrong price is a silent estimator bug →
  Morning Review). | files: Models/ProviderModels.swift, OCR/OCRProcessor+OCR.swift, OCR/LLMTextClient.swift,
  OCR/LLMRotationDetector.swift, Models/KeychainHelper.swift | M | low | none
  — ✅ shipped: `.openai = "OpenAI"` appended; `openaiModels` (all IDs/pricing `// VERIFY`); param adapter
  (`OpenAICompatibleClient.openAI(model:apiKey:)` → `max_completion_tokens` for reasoning models, gateway path
  byte-identical); `.openai` arms added to all **12** exhaustive `LLMProvider` switches (OCR/classify/text route
  via the factory; batch/cancel/rotation defensive-`nil` since `supportsBatch=false`; CostEstimator image-tokens
  placeholder + rotation `nil`). Additive + opt-in — default provider unchanged. KeychainHelper needed no change
  (account = `provider.rawValue`). Build clean, 0 new warnings. **Live OCR + model-ID/pricing verification =
  keyed/owner tail → Morning Review** (Processor has no unit target; smoke needs a live key). ProviderKeySpec /
  onboarding / validation / CostEstimator rows = W13.oai-2; gateway preset + docs = W13.oai-3.
- [x] **W13.oai-2 — onboarding + validation + cost.** `ProviderKeySpec.openai` (+ `onboardable`),
  `KeyValidator.validateOpenAI` (`GET /v1/models`), `ThinkingLevel → reasoning_effort`, `CostEstimator` rows
  (placeholder-priced per above). | files: Models/ProviderKeySpec.swift, OCR/KeyValidator.swift, Models/CostEstimator.swift | S | low | none
  — ✅ shipped: `ProviderKeySpec.openai` added to `onboardable` (guided wizard now offers OpenAI: platform.openai.com
  deep links, `sk-` precheck, no-free-tier cost/card notes, API-not-trained privacy note; URLs/wording `// VERIFY`
  → keyed tail). `KeyValidator.validateOpenAI` (cheap `GET /v1/models` Bearer → 200 works / 401·403 invalidKey /
  429 rateLimited / 5xx providerBusy; mirrors `validateMistral`; documents that /v1/models 200s even with no
  credits → live smoke surfaces insufficient-quota). `ThinkingLevel.openAIReasoningEffort` (low/high) wired through
  the `openAI(model:apiKey:thinkingLevel:)` factory, **gated on `supportsThinking`** so `reasoning_effort` is sent
  only to reasoning models; threaded at the OCR + tagging-text call sites (classification stays reasoning-free).
  Settings gained an **OpenAI manual key field** (generic `keyField` helper, Save/Validated chips) + guided-button/
  help wording; `ContentView.hasAnyKey` counts an OpenAI key. `CostEstimator` `.openai` arms already landed in
  oai-1. Additive + opt-in — default provider unchanged. Build clean, 0 new warnings; Tier-1 self-review.
  **GUI visual (Settings OpenAI row + wizard) + live OCR smoke = keyed/owner tail → Morning Review** (GUI blocked
  this run by the Keychain "Always Allow" seed still being unset under the stable dev cert).
- [ ] **W13.oai-3 — gateway "OpenAI" preset + docs.** One-click preset prefilling base URL/model/cost (note:
  custom base URL covers Azure OpenAI / proxies); update CLAUDE.md provider list + README. | files: Views/SettingsView.swift, docs | S | low | none

**Local Agent CLI provider** (`execution-plans/local-agent-cli-provider.md`; Tier-2; fake-CLI harness makes the
whole gate unattended-satisfiable at $0):
- [ ] **W13.cli-1 — client + config + additive threading.** `OCR/LocalAgentClient.swift` (ocr + textCompletion)
  + `Models/LocalAgentConfig.swift` (append-only) + thread `localAgent: LocalAgentConfig?` (default nil) beside
  `gatewayConfig`. Tests: committed **fake-CLI** stub (canned JSON) + the **resume-safety decode** test (a
  pre-change run snapshot still decodes, `localAgent` absent→nil). Tier-2, satisfiable unattended. | M | med | none
- [ ] **W13.cli-2 — validator + Settings.** `OCR/LocalAgentValidator.swift` (`cliNotFound`/`cliNotLoggedIn`/
  `cliEntitlementMissing`) + Settings controls (`useLocalAgent` XOR `useGateway`, tool picker, path, model,
  additive DefaultsKeys, `?` help + gray-out). Detect+Verify live round-trip → GUI/Morning Review. | M | low | none
- [ ] **W13.cli-3 — wizard + cost pane + pacing.** `LocalAgentSpec` (claude + gemini specs), cost pane
  "Included in your subscription" branch, low concurrency cap (1–2) + usage-window handling. | S | low | none
- [ ] **W13.cli-4 — pipeline wiring.** Prefer `localAgent` at the construction sites; skip batch + LLM-rotation
  when active; extend `test-smoke.sh` to run the **fake-CLI** path (skip gracefully when no real CLI). | M | med | none

**Keyed / owner tail (NOT daemon-buildable — flag to Morning Review, do not attempt unattended):** OpenAI live
2-image OCR smoke through gateway + native `.openai` (owner supplies a key). _(Model-ID + pricing `// VERIFY`
placeholders RESOLVED 2026-07-16: `openaiModels` replaced with the current GPT-5 generation (gpt-5-nano/-mini/
5.4-mini/5.4/5.5) priced per the owner-provided SoCOCRbench source; live-key OCR smoke remains the final ID
confirmation.)_
CLI `gemini`+`codex` install + entitlement confirmation (Phase 0) and the real-CLI live OCR smoke
(the `claude` path can't run inside a Claude Code session — nested-session guard); OpenAI Batch API (Phase 4) +
CLI persistent-`stream-json` perf (Phase 4). Land the build-verified code first; these gate final "shipped".

## Known-issues work — Wave 14 (cross-app; owner-requested 2026-07-16)
Actionable open items pulled from the three `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` + the Processor streaming-residuals review, ordered
by value. **Android straggler is first (HIGH).** Each notes what's daemon-buildable vs. the keyed/GUI verify tail.
Legend as above.
- [ ] **W14.1 — Android/iOS straggler: never finalize a partial segment [HIGH]** _(Processor KNOWN_ISSUES →
  "Per-capture streaming — residual refinements" #1; focus path: Android + LAN)._ The data-loss guard already
  ships (a straggler is never deleted), but a page still un-UPLOADED when `segment/complete` arrives is **not
  auto-filed** — it lingers unfiled in the Captured pane. **Fix (both companions, kept in sync):** the phone
  **defers `sendSegmentComplete`** (and `finishSession`'s `/session/complete`) until **every page of the segment
  is confirmed `UPLOADED`** — record a pending-complete group, flush it when its last page hits `UPLOADED` from
  BOTH the upload-success path and the auto-retry path. So the Mac never finalizes a partial segment. **Tier-2**
  (Capture/Net, phone↔Mac protocol — no wire-format change: this is send-*timing*, not a new field). Daemon-buildable:
  Android `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` + iOS `xcodebuild` build-clean + adversarial self-review of the
  defer/flush logic on both companions. **Keyed/owner verify tail:** the on-device / emulator E2E
  (`scripts/e2e-phone-mac.sh`, needs a Gemini key + the `ap_test` emulator; XCUITest admin-prompt caveat) →
  Morning Review. | files: ArchiveCapture/capture/CaptureViewModel.kt, ArchiveCaptureiOS/.../Capture/CaptureViewModel.swift | M | med | none(build)/owner(E2E)
- [ ] **W14.2 — Reader write-target identity re-verification (Safety §6) [MED]** _(Reader KNOWN_ISSUES →
  "Deferred hardening")._ `TagWriter.mutate` writes to whatever file currently occupies the URL; a Finder
  move/replace between Spotlight discovery and the write could apply the delta to the wrong file's tags. **Fix:**
  capture a stable identity (security-scoped bookmark / `fileResourceIdentifierKey`) at discovery and **re-verify
  the resolved URL's identity inside the `NSFileCoordinator` block before writing** — abort on mismatch. **Do NOT
  request `.documentIdentifierKey`** (it mutates on read). **Tier-2** (TagWriter). Fully daemon-buildable +
  unit-testable on scratch copies (extend the existing 191-test suite; never the real corpus). | files:
  packages/ArchiveCore/.../Tags/TagWrite.swift, ArchiveReader Core/TagWriter.swift | M | med | none
- [ ] **W14.3 — Notes: extract-paste imports inline-image BYTES [MED]** _(Notes KNOWN_ISSUES → "Extracts
  create/copy-paste follow-ups")._ The copy side embeds image bytes and Create/Append persist them, but the live
  extract-editor **paste** handler still inserts image *references* without importing the payload's bytes into the
  extract's own `assets/` (and rewriting refs on name collision) — so a live copy→paste renders missing-asset
  placeholders until re-saved via Create/Append. **Fix:** in `MarkdownEditorView.handlePassagePaste` →
  `ExtractBuilder.pastedExtractMarkdown`, import the `com.archivenotes.passage` payload bytes into the extract's
  `assets/` (reuse `ItemAssetStore` reserve→write; no-overwrite guard) and rewrite refs on collision. Store +
  payload bytes both already exist. **Tier-1/2** (writes to the Notes store — scratch-testable). Daemon-buildable +
  unit-testable (`ExtractBuilder`/`ItemAssetStore` tests); GUI copy→paste drive → Morning Review. | files:
  ArchiveNotes/.../Editor/MarkdownEditorView.swift, Core/ExtractBuilder.swift | M | low | none
- [ ] **W14.4 — Notes W7 polish cluster [LOW]** _(Notes KNOWN_ISSUES → W7-S2/S3/S4 follow-ups)._ Small, mostly
  independent: (a) **trivial warning** — `Core/NotePassageSource.swift:118` "conditional cast … always succeeds"
  (pure daemon fix, no GUI); (b) programmatic **window-raise + select** on Create-Extract and on Jump-to-Source
  (select+scroll already works; only `orderFront`/focus is missing — needs a shared open-request channel; GUI
  verify); (c) chip **reactive title** refresh (today refreshes only on re-style); (d) per-window **Sources column**
  visibility (today always present). Do (a) standalone now; (b)–(d) build-verifiable, GUI drive → Morning Review.
  **Tier-1.** | files: ArchiveNotes/.../Core/NotePassageSource.swift, NotesModel.swift, Views/* | S | low | none
- [ ] **W14.5 — Processor legacy staging-manifest rotation review [LOW, do last]** _(Processor KNOWN_ISSUES #1;
  cannot recur for current-build sessions — only legacy manifests restore `staged` without `retained`)._ Fix
  option 1 (cleanest per the write-up): on legacy-manifest recovery, **drop those segments from
  `staged`/`finalizedGroups`** so they re-process from scratch (re-OCR + re-tag → proper `retained`), giving a
  complete rotation review. **Do NOT** naively "show all staged pages" — regenerating a legacy page seeded at 0°
  would *un-rotate* an auto-rotated page (strictly worse). **Verify needs a legacy manifest + an OCR key to
  reprocess → keyed/owner**; the recovery-branch code change is build-verifiable. LOW value. | files:
  Capture/LiveCaptureProcessor.swift (loadStagingManifest / finishSession) | S | low | owner(verify)

**Parked — explicitly NOT a Wave-14 work item:** Processor cloud/relay **post-finalize reclassify → duplicate
output** (A11, MED, Drive-milestone) lives entirely in the **Google-Drive relay path**, which is **ON HOLD /
maintain-only** (see §Project focus). Leave parked until the Drive milestone is un-held; do not build it unattended.

## Suite doc hygiene (owner / small) — 2026-07-16
- [ ] **Fold Archive Notes `00-overview.md` §16 (Interface Contract) into `ArchiveNotes/CLAUDE.md` or promote to
  `SPEC/`, then delete the plan.** The per-wave Notes plans shipped + were deleted; `00-overview.md` is retained
  only because §2/§5/§16 are still cited by `ArchiveNotes/CLAUDE.md`. Doc-only; Tier-1. | S | low | none
- **Owner note (not a daemon item):** 4 stray sibling worktrees (`suite-wt-20260714-174815-…`,
  `-20260714-224217-…`, `-20260715-002837-…`, `-20260715-194019-…`) are **merged to origin/main but hold
  uncommitted WIP** (Notes GUI-test-harness scratch files) — the daemon flagged them "manual review." Salvage or
  discard by hand, then `git worktree remove`. The `~/Documents/GPT/archive-suite-processor-fixes` worktree is a
  different agent's (Codex) — leave it.

## Archive Notes — NEW APP (SHIPPED W0–W8, 2026-07; `execution-plans/archive-notes/00-overview.md` retained)
Owner-specced third Suite app; foundational decisions locked (D1–D10, `00-overview.md §2`). **All waves shipped;
the per-wave plans (`00a`, `01`–`08`) were deleted on ship** (git history + the W0–W8 `[x]` records below are the
account); only `00-overview.md` is retained as the authoritative interface contract. DevonThink informs **only**
the 3-pane browsing shell — everything else (note appearance, link/provenance UI, replication semantics) is
purpose-built for the historian's provenance-first workflow. **Owner decision points (early):** (a) **R13d** —
the `ArchiveSuite` *exclusion* effect is deferred to the later behavior/data follow-on (see `00 §2` call-out).
**Confirmed (owner):** the FULL **ArchiveCore extraction + Reader/Processor migration is W0 — done FIRST** (`00a`),
before any Notes-specific work.
- [x] **W0** **ArchiveCore extraction + Reader/Processor migration (FIRST)** — create `packages/ArchiveCore`, move
  the shared tag/PDF/date contract (facet parser + `sortDate` + read + the audited **write** path + Processor
  vocabulary/formatting + `PDFTextExtractor`/`PDFFormatStatus` + new `RootMarker`/`DurableLink` + `ArchiveSuite`
  recognition) out of both shipping apps and migrate them onto it; behavior-preserving, parity-gated, one audited
  write seam; adds the SPEC delta — `00a-archivecore-refactor.md` — **Tier-2** (TagWriter + both apps + SPEC)
  (S0 `f050d88` → S5 `cd7ff4f` → S6 `b90800f`)
- [x] **W1** scaffold + app skeleton **depending on the W0 ArchiveCore** — `01-scaffolding-and-core.md` — Tier-2 (scaffold)
  (S1 `7cddf60` → S2 `254fd73` → S3 `91c3c45` → S4 `220b582` → S5 docs)
- [x] **W2** store + front-matter I/O + virtual folders/replication + FTS5 index — `02-storage-model-and-index.md` — Tier-2 (writers)
  (S1 `64eaa9c` → S2 `02201f0` → S3 `2404852` → S4 `afd06c7` → S5 org graph + organization.json)
- [x] **W3** rich-text/Markdown editor (WYSIWYG + raw toggle, inline images) — `03-rich-text-markdown-editor.md` — Tier-1
  (S1 `0db7f61` → S2 `16e0f43` → S3 `1f740b3` → S4 `2261b1f` → S5 `78a9fb5` → S6 perf+cache+tests)
- [x] **W4** source blocks + page thumbnails + Reader URL scheme/reveal + durable links — `04-sources-and-cross-app-linking.md` — Tier-2 (Reader deep-link)
  (S1 `0b7b89d` → S2 `8a7012c` → S3 `1e81b71` → S4 `f477f3a` → S5 `15c690c` → S6 `0ddf88e` → S7 reveal+preview)
- [x] **W5** Zotero metadata / citations / chips — `05-zotero-integration.md` — Tier-1
  (S1 `3704c6a` → S2 `2dac700` → S3 `97547c1` → S4 `f420346` → S5 settings + degrade polish)
- [x] **W6** viewers + search/filter/sort + replication UI + templates + dates/quality — `06-viewers-search-replication.md` — Tier-2 (delete path)
  (S1 `27d3952` → S2 `70bfd1e` → S3 `c37f175` → S4 `92f84f4` → S5 `3d46c0d` → S6 `598d2f2` → S7 dates & quality UI)
- [x] **W7** extracts (snapshot + provenance, blocks→notes, jump-to-source) — `07-extracts.md` — Tier-1
  (S1 `f5efe60` → S2 `71ca1db` → S3 `50920ce` → S4 `c8c93ee` → S5 `328bff3` → S6 app-quit/window-close autosave flush)
- [x] **W8** tests + XCUITest/cliclick GUI harness (scratch corpus) — `08-testing-and-gui-verification.md` — Tier-1/2
  (S1 `0f164ed` → S2 `6ef2244` → S3 `3aa27e2` → S4 `6f22159` → S5 `2a412c9` → S6 `6ce10a6` →
  S7 GUI-harness scaffold `98a4afc`–`0e7472c` → S8 per-wave GUI checks `f79e279`–`267ca8d` +
  S8b probe-queryability + owner-eye README → S9 durable-link E2E `17a2d27`/`7d2dcb8` + `GUI_SAFETY.md`)
  — **W8 COMPLETE (GUI-on):** full `ArchiveNotesUITests` suite (G0–G11 + Smoke) **13/13 TEST EXECUTE SUCCEEDED**;
  the `an.status.indexReady` probe is now XCUITest-queryable (G0); owner-eye checks (G2/G6/G11 + chip clicks)
  documented in `ArchiveNotes/scripts/GUI-HARNESS.md`. **Completes Archive Notes (Wave 11 / W0–W8).**
- [ ] **W9 (gap-closure)** post-ship reconciliation from the 2026-07-16 plan-vs-build review (all W0–W8 verified
  substantially complete + data-safe; these are the promised-but-absent / partial / built-but-not-wired deltas)
  — `09-gap-closure.md` — mixed Tier-1/Tier-2 per item; ends with a **verification review (Phase E)** that gates
  deleting the plan:
  - **Phase A — docs/tracker (DOC):** write `ArchiveNotes/README.md` + `AGENTS.md`; add Notes to root `README.md`;
    finish the SPEC `ArchiveSuite` marker section (**Tier-2**); delete shipped plans `00a`/`03`/`07`/`08`; fix stale
    `SUITE_TODO`/`CLAUDE.md`-map entries; add `SMOKE_TEST.md`; drop `@testable` in `DocumentTagsTests`.
  - **Phase B — wire built-but-dead features (HIGH→MED):** Zotero auto-fill action + note-level chips (dead code,
    no UI); note retitle/tag-edit path; page-thumbnail render end-to-end (Reader passes `thumbnailer:nil`); consume
    `archivenotes://open`; embed image bytes on the extract menu path; guided root re-grant. Mostly **Tier-2**.
  - **Phase C — safety-net tooling (MED):** add `archivecore` smoke step; Processor write-surface lint; extend the
    lint to ArchiveCore (uncaught `import AppKit` in Core) + run on Notes; scope Notes smoke to `-only-testing`;
    (opt) fix the documented tag-projector concurrent lost-update race. **Tier-2**.
  - **Phase D — secondary UI/polish (LOW–MED):** folder drag-reparent, richer row context menu, template-body
    editing, quality quick-edit, `roundup` UI-or-remove, raw-parse-failure banner, empty states, off-main
    large-paste parse + minor coverage/cosmetic. Tier-1.
  - **Phase E — verification review:** re-run the plan-vs-build gap analysis + drive the features at runtime to
    prove every A–D item is actually done + **wired** (not "built but dead" again) before flipping this checkbox.
- [ ] **(later)** behavior/data follow-ons (W0 already unified the *code*): Reader parses/**hides** `ArchiveSuite` in-UI; corpus **back-fill** + Processor **stamping**; unified suite storage path — Tier-2, separately gated

## ✅ Document-viewer bugs (owner-reported 2026-07-06) — RESOLVED & owner-verified
All fixed and confirmed by the owner (round-3 commit `d4eedba`): open-maximized + remember-size with no
flash; text selection after cycling (fresh `PDFView` per page); zoom persistence across cycling *and* as
default incl. trackpad-pinch (`PDFViewScaleChanged` capture); top-anchored zoom; splitter persistence.
Files: `DocumentWindowView`/`DocumentViewerModel`/`PDFPaneView`/`AppSettings`/`ArchiveReaderApp`.

## P0 — Finish the Suite publish (network back)
- [x] Push merged history: `main` + `suite-v1.0.0` pushed to `origin` (0 diverged). ✅ 2026-07-06
- [x] Publish release: `suite-v1.0.0` LIVE with `ArchiveSuite-1.0.0.dmg` (4.48 MB) attached. ✅
- [x] Verify online: release published, asset `uploaded`; `origin/main` == locally build-verified tree. ✅
- [x] **Phase F DONE** — redirect banner pushed to the old `archiveprocessor` README; repo **archived** (read-only, `isArchived=true`). ✅ 2026-07-06

## P1 — Quick local wins (S, low-risk, no network)
- [x] Cite `SPEC/tag-format.md` as the shared-contract source of truth from BOTH per-app `CLAUDE.md`. ✅
- [x] Reconcile Reader `CLAUDE.md` prose to SPEC (doc-only; code already correct): page-2 line verbatim/any-ext/may-be-absent; Year 3–4 digits; BC note clarified; Box/Folder/OCR-Failed subjects noted. ✅
- [x] Regression test: `Box`/`Folder`/`OCR Failed` classify as plain subjects (SPEC #3) — added; **110 tests green**. ✅
- [x] Close stale checkbox: near-term-UI item **E3** confirmed shipped & ticked. ✅
- [x] Processor: "Import tag vocabulary from CSV" — added `Import from CSV…` button + file drop target on the vocabulary editor (`SettingsView.swift`; NSOpenPanel + newline/comma parse, de-dupe). macOS build green, no new warnings. ✅
- [x] **Android `targetSdk` 34→36 — DONE 2026-07-08** (builds clean + Android-16 emulator smoke PASSED). Toolchain: installed `platforms;android-36` + `build-tools;36.0.0`; AGP 8.6.1→8.9.1; Gradle 8.9→8.11.1; `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 34→36; `:app:assembleDebug` **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (JDK 21). **On-device smoke on the `ap_test36` (API-36 / Android 16) emulator PASSED:** app launches, both connect screens render with correct system-bar insets (no edge-to-edge clipping — screenshots checked), full capture flow drove (pair → 2× shutter → End segment → Skip → Box marker), **camera opened** (CameraService connect), and the phone→Mac protocol ran against a stub (`/ping`, 20× `/phone/status` heartbeat, 3× `/photo`, `/segment/complete`) — **no crash, no foreground-service/permission FATAL, 0 FATAL EXCEPTION**. *(Nice-to-have before Play submission: a final pass on a physical Android 15/16 device — emulator ≈ device but not identical.)* | files: ArchiveCapture/ | done
- [x] Reconcile Bonjour service-name mismatch — iOS now advertises `_archivecap._tcp` (matches the Mac) in both `ArchiveCaptureiOS/project.yml` + generated `Info.plist`; iOS project regenerates clean. ✅

## P2 — Reader features (no network; local build/test)
- [x] Non-standard-PDF **detection layer** — `Core/PDFFormatStatus.swift` (standard/unreadable/noTextLayer; page count is NOT a defect signal — merged >2-page PDFs are legit); persisted in the v2 content index. **117 tests green, lint clean.** ✅
- [x] Surface it — filter-bar "N need attention" toggle (`needsAttentionOnly` filter), health-popover row, per-row ⚠ badge. ✅
- [x] Viewer banner for image-only docs ("no OCR text layer") in the document window — build green. ✅
- [x] Tag near-duplicate detection — `Core/TagSimilarity.swift` (union-find + length-scaled Levenshtein) + `SimilarTagsSheet` review UI (Merge drives the existing audited rename). 130 tests green, lint clean. ✅
- [x] Duplicate-filename disambiguation — `Core/DuplicateNames.swift` + a dimmed containing-folder subtitle for rows sharing a base name. 135 tests green, lint clean. ✅
- ~~Side-by-side compare of two selected documents~~ — **dropped (owner: not doing this), 2026-07-06.**

**→ Reader P2 is COMPLETE** (non-standard-PDF cluster · tag near-duplicate finder · document-viewer bugs · dup-filename; side-by-side dropped).

## P2 — Reader performance
- [x] **Parallelize + batch the content-index build** *(Part A — build speed)* — bounded parallel
  `withTaskGroup` extraction + `upsertBatch` + WAL/`synchronous=NORMAL` + `existingMTimes()` +
  `performMaintenance`. 185 tests green. Tier-2 APPROVE. | done
- [x] **Ranked (bm25) search + search-during-index refresh** *(Parts B+C)* — bm25 relevance-ranked
  search (SQL `ORDER BY bm25`, column weights name=10/class=5/body=1, ordered `[String]` return,
  `ftsRank` map, `.relevance` auto-sort, lifecycle + persistence coercion) + auto-refresh active FTS
  query on index pass completion. 186 tests green. Tier-2 APPROVE. | done
- [x] **Prune the content index** — gated cache eviction: `!isGathering && !files.isEmpty` +
  two-emission absence confirmation + component-boundary root scope + batched deletes. Its own pass
  (`pruneIfSettled`), not folded into `startIndexing`. Root-switch resets pending-prune state.
  Corpus-wide counts now correct at source (the `among:`-scoped workaround stays as defense-in-depth).
  191 tests green (5 new). Tier-2 APPROVE (7/7 vectors). | done

## Owner-requested batch (2026-07-09) — Processor output + Reader UX/viewer
Captured verbatim from the owner; file hints are from the Reader/Processor Implementation Maps (verify
at implementation). Not yet scoped into execution plans — the **decades** item likely warrants one
(cross-app + SPEC). Legend as above (S/M/L · risk · needs).

### Archive Processor
- [x] **Multi-column OCR output layout** — `textColumns` setting (1/2/3, default 1) in Settings +
  ProcessingProfiles; body text on page 2 flows into N CoreText columns (header stays single-column,
  full-width). Threaded through OCRProcessor, SessionProcessingConfig, LiveCaptureProcessor (Codable-safe
  with `decodeIfPresent` fallback). Build clean 0 new warnings. Tier-2 APPROVE (7/7 vectors). 7 synthetic
  tests green. GUI-verify deferred: verify on a real multi-column newspaper scan → Morning Review. | done
- [x] **Multi-page PDF → per-page LLM OCR → single alternating image/OCR-text PDF** _(owner-requested 2026-07-15; SHIPPED — new "Re-OCR multi-page PDF" Process-Files mode)_
  — a NEW Process-Files mode: accept an existing **multi-page PDF**, render EACH page to an image, send each
  page-image to the LLM for OCR (re-OCR the page images — distinct from the existing `preOCRedInput` mode, which
  only extracts the embedded text layer), and output ONE PDF whose pages **alternate image, OCR-text, image,
  OCR-text, …** (each source page → its image page + a selectable OCR-text page). **Mostly assembles from
  existing primitives:** `PDFGenerator.mergeDocumentPDFs` already interleaves image1,text1,image2,text2,…;
  `OCRProcessor.performOCRCall` is already per-single-image; `PDFGenerator.generate` builds the per-page
  image+text unit. **New bits:** a "render ALL pages" variant of `PDFToImageConverter` (today hard-codes
  `page(at: 0)`); a pipeline branch in `OCRProcessor.startProcessing` / `convertPDFInputs` that fans one input
  PDF into N page-jobs then reuses generate+merge; a mode toggle beside `preOCRedInput` (+ a `DefaultsKeys` entry)
  in `OCRView.swift`. **Tier-2** (PDF-writing output — adversarial review + scratch-copy functional test, NEVER
  the real corpus). SPEC: add a short note to `SPEC/tag-format.md` §2-page structure (the interleaved shape
  already matches multi-page-document output + is covered by the "consumers must not hard-assume 2 pages" clause,
  so it's a coordinated Processor+Reader+SPEC clarification, not a format break). |
  files (verify at impl): OCR/PDFToImageConverter.swift, OCR/PDFGenerator.swift (generate + mergeDocumentPDFs),
  OCR/OCRProcessor+OCR.swift (performOCRCall, convertPDFInputs), OCR/OCRProcessor+Pipeline.swift (startProcessing),
  Views/OCRView.swift (intake + mode toggle), SPEC/tag-format.md | M | med | none
  — **DONE:** `DefaultsKeys.reOCRMultiPagePDF` + `ProcessingProfileStore`; `PDFToImageConverter.renderAllPages`
  (fail-loud, no partial set); `OCRProcessor.performMultiPagePDFReOCR` (render all pages → per-page OCR via
  `performOCRCall` → `PDFGenerator.generate` per page → `mergeDocumentPDFs` into ONE alternating image/OCR-text
  PDF), branched in `startProcessing` BEFORE `preOCRedInput`; a pure transform (no Finder tags — output never
  overwrites the input via `uniqueOutputURL`). Settings toggle (mutually exclusive with pre-OCRed; disables
  batch + separate-image export), Process-Files "Drop PDFs here" intake + PDF accept-gate + grayed Tagging box.
  SPEC §2-page-structure interleaved-variant note added. **Tier-2:** adversarial self-review + `$0`/key-free
  functional test `scripts/test-multipage-reocr.sh` (`MultiPageReOCRTestDriver`, 11/11 PASS incl. the
  input-overwrite guard); merge-safety regression still green; build clean, 0 new warnings. GUI visual check
  (toggle render / drop-zone flip) deferred → Morning Review (launch-time Keychain prompt blocks it unattended).
- [ ] **De-dup sweep from the 2026-07-04 maintainability audit — REMAINDER ONLY** _(promoted 2026-07-15;
  re-scoped 2026-07-16 after finding suite-v1.2.0 already did most of it)_. **`f1d2263` (suite-v1.2.0) ALREADY
  SHIPPED 5 of the listed consolidations — do NOT redo:** `highestLeadingNumber` (→ `Capture/CollectionNumbering.swift`),
  `monthTag`/`englishMonthNames` (→ `GeneratedTags`), `acceptedImageExtensions` (→ `ImageEncoding`),
  `GatewayConfig.fromDefaults()`, `liveProcessingMode` **enum**. **GENUINE REMAINDER (~6, verified still duplicated
  in-tree 2026-07-16):** a shared transient-status friendly-message helper (4 OCR clients); a segment-JSON schema
  builder (2 sites); `OCRResult.with(...)` copy helpers; `LLMRotationDetector.rotate` → `ImageEncoding.rotate`
  (`LLMRotationDetector.swift:150` still a private copy — its own comment says "mirrors ImageEncoding.rotate");
  `ThinkingLevel.budgetTokens` + the Anthropic max_tokens bump (4 clients — `thinkingBudget` is 1024/4000,
  512/2000, and two `budget` vars, i.e. budgets differ **by call type**, so KEEP that difference — this one is
  request-body-affecting if mis-merged); Gemini `cancelBatch` via the shared URL builder.
  ⚠️ **VERIFICATION CONSTRAINT:** the Processor has **no unit-test target** and its only functional test needs an
  OCR API key (deleted W4.0.a) — so "prove equivalence" here = build-green + byte-identical diff inspection; the
  `budgetTokens` sub-item (request-body-affecting) should be done in a keyed/owner session, not guessed unattended.
  **Tier-1** (touches no write path). | files: OCR/*, Capture/LiveCaptureProcessor.swift, Views/* | M | low | none
  — **W12-dedup progress 2026-07-16 — 5 of 6 shipped** (byte-identical, build-clean, no new warnings):

  `OCRErrorMessages.transientStatusMessage(_:)` across all 4 clients' `parseErrorResponse` + (3) Gemini
  `cancelBatch` via `makeBatchURL` `6c52dd4`; (4) `OCRResult.with(classification:rotationDegrees:)` copy helper —
  7 review/retry re-creations, preserves errorCode (the W9.1 footgun) `94d4ef6`; (5) **segment-JSON sidecar
  builder** — Tier-2 (file-WRITE format): new pure `OCR/SegmentJSONBuilder.swift` (`cf4f509`) that both
  `OCRProcessor.writeSegmentJSON` + `LiveCaptureProcessor.writeSegmentJSON` now delegate to — disk-write surface
  (sidecar-URL + atomic write) left unchanged; the OCRProcessor-only `box_label`/`folder_label` divergence is a
  `formatOverride:` param via `SegmentJSONBuilder.labelFormatOverride`. Proven byte-identical to BOTH originals
  by a $0 key-free 12-case / 30-assert driver (`SEGMENT_JSON_TEST=1` + `scripts/test-segment-json.sh`,
  `6d9a877`; call sites wired in the flip commit) — ALL PASS. **⏸️ 1 REMAINING is OWNER/KEYED — Wave-12 SKIP
  (do NOT attempt unattended):** (6) **`ThinkingLevel.budgetTokens`** — request-body-affecting (512/2000 vs
  1024/4000 differ by call type) → keyed/owner session per the VERIFICATION CONSTRAINT above (Processor has no
  unit target + its only functional test needs the deleted OCR key). See Morning Review.
- [x] **Shared provider text-completion client** — **ALREADY SHIPPED `f1d2263` (suite-v1.2.0), before the
  2026-07-15 promotion re-listed it.** `OCR/LLMTextClient.swift` is the shared text-completion client;
  `TagGenerator` + `CollectionSegmenter` both delegate to it, each keeping its own `maxTokens`/timeout so request
  bodies stay byte-identical (the Mistral-signature drift was reconciled deliberately, not blind-merged).
  Verified in-tree 2026-07-16 (file present; both callers reference it). Promoted-in-error 2026-07-15 (`1ee659c`) —

- [x] **Live Capture output-folder picker** — **ALREADY SHIPPED `782dfdd` (suite-v1.2.0), before the 2026-07-15
  promotion re-listed it.** LiveCaptureView has the picker (`chooseOutputFolder()` + NSOpenPanel), a "Choose…"
  button, the current-destination "Output folder" row, a `?` HelpButton, and gray-out in Stage-for-later mode —
  unified on the SAME `DefaultsKeys.outputDirectory` as Process Files (one source of truth). Verified in-tree
  2026-07-16. Promoted-in-error 2026-07-15 (`1ee659c`). **Residual (owner):** the owner's promoted wish said the
  default should be "not Downloads"; the shipped default is Downloads-if-unset (visible + changeable via the

  Morning Review. | files: Views/LiveCaptureView.swift | done
- [x] **Cost tracking + processing history** _(promoted 2026-07-15; SHIPPED 2026-07-16)_ — persist each run's **actual**
  cost plus a run log (timestamp, provider/model, file count, results/failures) and surface a simple history view.
  `CostEstimator` already does the per-model math for *estimates*; this records **actuals** and accumulates them.
  Writes only its own store (Application Support / UserDefaults) — **never** the corpus. **Tier-1**.
  | files: Models/CostEstimator.swift, Models/DefaultsKeys.swift, Views/ToolsView.swift (or a new history view) | M | low | none
  — **SHIPPED:** `Models/ProcessingHistory.swift` — `ProcessingRun` + in-memory `RunHistorySnapshot` (params captured at
  run start; cost = the SAME `CostEstimator` math the pre-run pane shows, applied to what ACTUALLY ran — no provider
  returns per-call token usage) + bounded (200) `ProcessingHistoryStore` (JSON in UserDefaults, never the corpus).
  `OCRProcessor` records at EVERY genuine completion tail (startProcessing + resumeRun pre-OCRed/standard + resumeBatch;
  resume snapshots rebuilt from the persisted manifest + live rotation/scale); cancel/interrupt paths never record.
  `Views/ProcessingHistoryView.swift` — a Tools-tab sheet (per-run provider·model/mode/counts/cost, summary totals,
  confirm-gated Clear; cost footnoted as an estimate, not billed). **Tier-1** verified: build clean, 0 new warnings +
  `$0`/no-key/no-GUI headless self-test `scripts/test-processing-history.sh` (`ProcessingHistoryTestDriver`, 19/19 PASS,
  against a THROWAWAY UserDefaults suite — never the operator's real history). Visual GUI check deferred (launch-time
  Keychain prompt blocks the Processor GUI unattended) → Morning Review.
- [x] **Global keyboard shortcuts + dark-mode pass** _(promoted 2026-07-15; re-scoped 2026-07-16; VERIFIED 2026-07-16)_ —
  Tier-1 audit; **no code change needed** (both sub-items already correct in-tree — churning clean code would be worse).
  **(a) Shortcut coverage — complete & correct:** `Views/ProcessingCommands.swift` exposes the two main-window
  commands (⌘R Start Processing, ⌘⌥P Cycle Provider) as a menu-bar `CommandMenu` = the single source (key
  equivalents shown; routes via `NotificationCenter` → MainActor observers with a `TextEditingGuard` so a shortcut
  never steals a keystroke). Every OTHER `.keyboardShortcut` in the app is a `.defaultAction`/`.cancelAction`/⌘Return
  **scoped to a modal sheet** (correctly NOT global menu commands) — matches the Reader's "menu bar = single source"
  convention. **(b) Dark-mode — static audit clean:** all chrome uses adaptive `Color(nsColor: .controlBackgroundColor
  / .windowBackgroundColor / .textBackgroundColor)`; text uses `.primary`/`.secondary`/`.tertiary` + adaptive accents;
  `white`/`black` literals appear ONLY for document/paper rendering (thumbnail/PDF-output/OCR-test canvases — must
  stay), modal scrims (`black.opacity(…)` — intentional dimming), and glyphs/text on dark scrims or saturated colored
  badges; the one AppKit token field sets `drawsBackground = false` (the adaptive pattern). No custom `Color` palette/
  extension, no named-image chrome (`Image(systemName:)` only), no forced `.preferredColorScheme` / `NSApp.appearance`
  / `window.backgroundColor` override. **Human visual dark-mode spot-check deferred → Morning Review** (the Processor
  GUI can't launch unattended — blocking login-Keychain prompt; no Processor XCUITest harness). | files (audited):

  re-running a directory now processes only new/changed files instead of redoing everything (matters at 150k scale).
  Skip key = the owner-specified one: an existing `<output>/<base>.pdf` whose mtime is no older than the source.
  **Fail safe: when in doubt, PROCESS** — never silently skip a file that needed processing. **Tier-2** (a wrong
  skip = silently missing output). | files: OCR/OCRProcessor+Pipeline.swift, Views/OCRView.swift | M | med | none
  — **DONE:** new pure `OCR/IncrementalSkip.swift` (`partition(inputs:outputDirectory:)`) is the safety-critical
  decision core; skips a source ONLY when its base name is unique among inputs, the candidate `<out>/<base>.pdf`
  is a distinct file (not the source itself), exists as a regular file, both mtimes are readable, and source
  mtime ≤ output mtime — every ambiguity falls through to PROCESS. Opt-in toggle `DefaultsKeys.skipAlreadyProcessed`
  (default OFF, Settings ▸ Input & Processing; also a `ProcessingProfile` key). Filtered at the top of
  `startProcessing` and confined to plain per-file output (skipped for Live Capture pre-grouped handoffs,
  collection-organized, and merged runs, where an output can't be attributed to one source — a safe no-op there);
  the skipped count is surfaced in the completion status, and an all-skipped run finishes with a clear
  "nothing to do". **Tier-2 verified** (no-key Processor): headless `$0` `scripts/test-incremental-skip.sh`
  (`IncrementalSkipTestDriver`, INCREMENTAL_SKIP_TEST=1) — **13/13 PASS** across every fail-safe branch,
  mktemp-isolated (never the corpus) — plus adversarial diff review + build clean, 0 new warnings. GUI visual
  check (toggle + status line) deferred → Morning Review (Processor GUI launch = blocking login-Keychain prompt).

### Capture companions (Android + iOS) — owner decisions 2026-07-15
- [x] **Remove the phone "Finish" button** _(owner decision 2026-07-15 — "get rid of it"; premise found STALE —
  already done, reconciled 2026-07-16 `W12-finish-button`)_ — the phone's **Finish**
  (`CaptureViewModel.finishSession()` → `MacClient.sessionComplete()` → `POST /session/complete`) is near-useless
  and actively misleading: the Mac handler (`CaptureServer.swift` ~L242) only sets a status string and returns OK —
  it does **not** start finalize, so the operator must still click **Finish session** on the Mac. **End segment**
  stays the phone's only "done" action; the Mac's Finish session stays the finalize trigger. Remove the button +
  its call from **both** companions (keep them in sync). **Leave the Mac's `/session/complete` route in place** (a
  harmless no-op) so an older/unupdated companion still works — do NOT change the protocol in the same pass.
  | files: ArchiveCapture/ui/CaptureScreen.kt + capture/CaptureViewModel.kt,
  ArchiveCaptureiOS/UI/CaptureScreen.swift + Capture/CaptureViewModel.swift | S | low | none
  — **ALREADY DONE (stale premise, like recent-years/de-dup).** The phone **Finish button + its `finishSession()`→
  `sessionComplete()` UI call are already gone from BOTH companions** — removed in `ce55511` ("Live capture: End
  segment is the only 'done' action"). Verified in-tree 2026-07-16: neither `CaptureScreen.swift` nor
  `CaptureScreen.kt` has a Finish button (both only expose **End segment** = `finishDocumentSegment()` →
  `segmentComplete(...)`, the segment signal — NOT `sessionComplete`); a full-tree grep finds **zero callers of
  `sessionComplete()`** in either companion's UI/Capture/Net; both UIs even carry a "there is no separate Finish"
  comment. The Mac's `POST /session/complete` route is intact (`CaptureServer.swift:284`), as the item requires.
  So the actionable scope (remove the button + its UI call, keep the Mac route) is fully satisfied — no code change.
  **Residual (OUT OF SCOPE this pass → Morning Review):** `sessionComplete()` survives as **dead protocol surface**
  in the Net/ transport layer (the `SegmentTransport` protocol + `MacClient`/`DriveRelayTransport`/`FileRelayTransport`
  impls, both companions). Removing it would touch the **frozen** `RelayObjectFormat` wire contract
  (`encodeSessionComplete` + the `sessionCompleteMatchesGolden` test) and the maintain-only cloud path, i.e. it
  **"changes the protocol"** — which the item explicitly forbids "in the same pass." Left as an optional future
  protocol-cleanup pass (owner-gated). Doc-only reconciliation (Tier-1, no build needed — tree == `a624ccf`).
- [x] **Cap recent years at 5 (both companions)** _(owner decision 2026-07-15; SHIPPED 2026-07-16)_ — both
  companions now cap the recent-years quick-chip list at **5** (was 6): iOS `Array(ys.prefix(5))`
  (`CaptureViewModel.noteYear`) + comment; Android `.take(5)` (`Prefs.noteYear`) + `max 5` doc comment. Kept in
  sync. Migration-safe (a previously-stored 6th year is truncated on the next `noteYear`; it is only a UI
  convenience list — no tag/corpus write, so Tier-1). **Verified:** iOS `xcodebuild` **BUILD SUCCEEDED** + Android
  `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**, no new warnings; no unit test asserts the cap. Visual
  chip-count check (needs seeding ≥6 recent years then opening the tag sheet on device/emulator — an
  E2E-harness-level drive, disproportionate for a one-line display cap) → Morning Review.

  crush the 2/10/20/100/1000 gradient into uniformly tiny text. | files: Views/NavigationWindowView.swift | S | low | done

  SPEC + Reader parse/sort/display/topicalTags + write-path safety (year supersedes decade) +
  Processor Year-field help text. 12 new unit tests (182 total green). Tier-2 APPROVE. Defaults
  applied for the 4 open questions (italic=yes, no Reader decade editor, no hard validator, cloud/filter
  exclusion structural). Plan deleted. | done

### Archive Reader — search
- [x] **Incremental (as-you-type) OCR search** — debounced 150ms Combine pipeline on `$fullTextQuery`
  triggers `runFullTextSearch()` as-you-type; FTS5 MATCH + bm25 is indexed and fast at scale; existing
  `ftsGeneration` token handles superseded queries. `.onSubmit` removed (debounce handles it); clear

  "N of M" count, and searches ACROSS every open document (both panes = page 0 + page 1) — not the corpus
  FTS. New `Core/DocumentFind.swift`: pure `FindNavigator` (reading-order match list + wrap cursor) +
  `DocumentFindScanner` (per-pane match counts via `PDFDocument.findString`). `PDFPaneController` grows
  find-highlight state reapplied on every view rebuild (mirrors the persisted-zoom pattern), so highlights
  survive page cycling; cross-document jumps set the pane target then change `index` so the rebuild applies
  it with no timing race. 10 new unit tests (`DocumentFindTests`, incl. a synthesized text-PDF scanner
  check); build clean 0 new warnings. Read-only → Tier-1. Live GUI drive (highlight render / scroll /

  show a `snippet()`-style **keyword-in-context** excerpt for each search hit (the matched OCR text with the query
  term highlighted) so results are scannable without opening each doc. FTS5 has `snippet()` **built in** and the
  content index **already stores the OCR `body`**, so this is a **search-UI addition, not an indexing change** —
  it layers on the shipped bm25 relevance ranking (and is distinct from the in-viewer find above: this is the
  corpus/library search). Read-only, no writes → **Tier-1**. Was deferred out of the `index-parallelization` plan
  (owner, 2026-07-09), which shipped ranking but explicitly not previews. | files (verify at impl):
  Search/ContentIndex.swift, Views/NavigationModel.swift, Views/NavigationWindowView.swift | M | low | none
  — **DONE:** `ContentIndex.searchRanked(query,snippetLimit)` returns every bm25-ordered match path (unchanged
  filtering surface) **plus** bounded FTS5 `snippet()` KWIC previews for the top hits — `snippet()` reads each
  doc body, so a `path IN (…)` filter caps the work at the top N rather than every match at 150k scale (an
  `ORDER BY bm25 … LIMIT` would still evaluate `snippet()` for every scanned row). New pure `Search/SearchSnippet.swift`
  (STX/ETX marker vocabulary shared by the SQL builder + the UI; robust segment parser). `NavigationModel` stores
  per-path snippets (`ftsSnippets`, cleared at every reset site) + `searchSnippet(for:)`; the AppKit list name cell
  grows to a dimmed 2nd keyword-in-context line for a hit (matched terms bold + faint adaptive-yellow wash) via the
  existing `usesAutomaticRowHeights`. **Tier-1** verified: 15 new unit tests (`SearchSnippetTests` + `ContentIndexTests`)
  green; build clean, no new warnings; **GUI-verified** by a new fixture XCUITest (`testOCRSearchShowsKeywordInContextSnippet`,
  **TEST SUCCEEDED**) that OCR-searches a body-only term ("California", in 9/11 fixture bodies, in no filename) and
  asserts the snippet line renders end-to-end. (Pre-existing env-only unit failure `DeepLinkTests.testRevealAndSelectNoRoot`
  — owner's real `archiveRootBookmark` in the shared unit-target UserDefaults — is unrelated → Morning Review.)

### Archive Reader — sort & smart folders
- [x] **Drop the top-bar Sort button; sort via column headers** — removed the toolbar Sort menu; primary
  sort via native column-header click (already wired via `sortDescriptorPrototype`); right-click header →
  secondary sort (asc/desc) + remove-secondary + reset-to-default via `ColumnPickerHeaderView`. Dead
  SwiftUI-Table sort code removed (`ArchiveFileComparator`, `sortComparators`, `applyTableSort`). 191 tests
  green, 0 warnings. | done
- [x] **Smart folders behave like a scoped root** — selecting a saved search enters a base scope; user
  filters layer on top; Clear returns to the base set, not the whole root. Sidebar shows a durable
  highlight. Scope persists across relaunch. `LibraryFilter.effective` merge for Save/summary. 170 tests
  green. Tier-2 APPROVE. | done

### Archive Reader — viewer & preview
- [x] **Single-page PDF with an embedded text layer → show its text as plain text (right pane)** — in both
  the document viewer and the navigator Preview, when a PDF has selectable text but no OCR page-2, extract
  the text layer via `embeddedText` and render it as selectable plain text in the right pane. Build clean,
  191 tests green. GUI-verify deferred (screen locked). | done
- [x] **Preview gets its own default zoom** — independent of the document viewer's persisted zoom; default
  to **full page** until the user changes it; on open, **focus the image pane** so keyboard zoom works
  immediately. `PDFPaneController(persists: false)` in preview mode; focus via async dispatch on appear.
  Build clean, 191 tests green. GUI-verify deferred (screen locked). | done
- [x] **⌘0 = "fit full page" everywhere zoom applies** — `.focusedObject(model)` on PreviewSheet
  publishes the viewer model so the existing Document menu ⌘0 (Fit Page) + zoom shortcuts reach the
  preview. Build clean, 191 tests green. GUI-verify: Document menu confirmed; preview-specific test
  deferred (scratch corpus not Spotlight-indexed). | done
- [x] **View non-PDFs (e.g. JPG) in the viewer** — tagged non-PDF images (JPG/PNG/TIFF/HEIC/BMP/GIF)
  now open in viewer + preview via PDFPage(image:) wrapping in DocumentViewerModel.loadCurrent().
  Build clean, 191 tests green. GUI-verify deferred (scratch corpus not Spotlight-indexed). | done

## Owner-requested (2026-07-10) — Reader
- [x] **Exclude a subfolder (inside the root) from indexing _and_ display** — a Settings control to
  name one or more folders under the current root that the Reader should treat as out of scope: their
  files are neither shown in the library nor added to the content index. UI lives in the Reader's
  **Settings** scene (`ArchiveReaderApp.swift:30` — add an "Excluded folders" section / list; a folder
  picker scoped under root that appends rows, each removable). Persist the exclusions (path prefixes,
  and/or security-scoped bookmarks like `RootFolderStore`) via `AppSettings`/a small store. **Apply at
  BOTH gates so "not indexed" and "not shown" actually hold:** (1) _display_ — filter files whose path is
  under an excluded prefix in `NavigationModel.libraryDidChange`/`recompute` (discovery is Spotlight-wide
  by tag in `ArchiveLibrary`, so match on path prefix, not search scope); (2) _index_ — skip excluded
  paths in `ContentIndexer.startIndexing`, **and prune already-indexed rows** under a newly-excluded
  folder (reuse the gated-prune path so search stops matching them; growth stays bounded). Reversible:
  un-excluding re-includes + re-indexes on the next library change. Edge cases: exclusion must be a
  descendant of root; overlapping/nested exclusions dedupe to the outermost; an excluded folder that
  later disappears is a no-op. Mostly build+unit verifiable (path-prefix filter, prune-on-exclude);
  GUI-verify the Settings list + that excluded rows vanish from the list and OCR search. **Not Tier-2**
  (no tag/corpus writes — read/index-side only). | files: `ArchiveReaderApp.swift` (Settings scene),
  new `Search/ExcludedFoldersStore.swift` (or `Core/AppSettings.swift`), `Views/NavigationModel.swift`,
  `Search/ContentIndexer.swift`, `Search/ArchiveLibrary.swift` | M | low

## Deferred from the 2026-07-09/10 autonomous run → queued for next autonomous run
Correctness bugs from that run's review shipped (`848c9d2`, `f866a0f`, `14118c0`); the items below were
consciously deferred (perf-only / LOW / GUI infra / new idea). All armed in `.maintenance/AUTONOMOUS_PLAN.md`
as **Waves 7–10** for the next daemon run (relaunch the daemon to start it — `ops/autonomous/README.md`).
- [x] **Prefix-match as-you-type OCR search** _(W10.1)_ — `ftsMatchExpression` appends `*` to the last token
  (>2 chars) for FTS5 prefix queries ("news" → "newspaper"). Min-length gate skips wildcard for ≤2-char tokens.
  3 new tests (196 total green), 0 warnings.
- [x] **Reader perf (deferred W6.2/W6.5)** _(W8.1)_ — (a) `displayedByID` rebuild gated by `displayedGeneration` counter (skips O(N) dict rebuild on unrelated `updateNSView` calls); (b) `tagCloud` cached + invalidated in `recompute()`. 193 tests green, 0 warnings.
- [x] **Processor OCR throughput (deferred W6.5 — M3–M5). Tier-2** _(W8.2)_ — M3 `handleOCRResult` PDF gen →
  `Task.detached(.utility)`; M4 `processBatchResults` rotation → bounded-concurrent `withTaskGroup`; M5
  Anthropic batch submit → incremental JSON serialization (1-image peak vs all-images). Tier-2 APPROVE
  (18 attack vectors). Build clean 0 warnings. | files: `OCR/OCRProcessor+OCR.swift`, `OCR/BatchOCR.swift` | M | low
- [x] **Processor OCR LOW cleanup (W6.4 L1–L4)** — L1 Gemini `cancelBatch` apiKey → `urlComponentEncoded`; L2
  preserve `errorCode` across 4 OCRResult re-creations; L3 documented `nonisolated(unsafe) static var` concurrency
  contract (write-once-per-run on MainActor, happens-before child tasks); L4 cache previous JPEG in Anthropic +
  Gemini batch loops. Build clean 0 warnings. | files: `OCR/BatchOCR.swift`, `OCR/OCRProcessor+ReviewFlows.swift`,
  `OCR/OCRProcessor.swift` | S | low
- [x] **Reader GUI test harness (XCUITest)** — W7.1–W7.5 shipped (target + accessibilityIdentifiers + fixture-root override + make-gui-fixture.sh + suite). **W7.6 (fixup) — all 14 tests now EXECUTE and PASS** (were 13/14 skipping): fixed the sandbox↔Spotlight fixture load (DEBUG off-Spotlight directory enumeration, since NSMetadataQuery returns nothing for a temporary-exception path), UITest↔owner shared-UserDefaults isolation (no view-state restore/persist in test mode — was inheriting the owner's live filter AND clobbering their settings), the tag-cloud element-type query + row/header click hittability, and marked the UI-test classes `@MainActor` (test-target warnings 171→32). PDFView content panes aren't XCUITest-queryable (framework limit) — asserted via observable chrome instead. | L | med

## P2 — Processor (KI#3 done; rest bucketed by how it can be verified)
**Done:**
- [x] KNOWN_ISSUES #3: zoomed-image scroll monitor no longer swallows scroll app-wide — scoped to the image via a hit-test-transparent probe (`ZoomableImageView.swift`); SwiftUI drag/pinch intact, no OCR/output logic touched. Build clean. ✅  ← GUI-verify (zoom a page >100%, confirm the filmstrip scrolls).

**Heads-down doable now (macOS, build-verifiable, NOT phone-gated):**
- [x] **[A1 — SHIPPED; owner-gated live-verify remains]** **Owner-requested (2026-07-07): bring the Live Capture Processing pane up to the Process Files "Files" pane's level of detail — on shared central code.** Today the Processing pane in Live Capture is too sparse: when a document **fails OCR the user gets no reason**, and there's **no way to (re)process just one or two files**. It should show the same per-file detail as the Process Files "Files" pane (status, OCR text/error reason, per-file actions) and offer the same **granular fallback/retry options** (retry a single file, change model/rotation and re-run, etc.). The pane likely needs to be **larger** to fit this. **DRY — don't invent it twice:** factor the Process Files file-list + row + per-file action UI into a **shared component** so both the Process Files pane and the Live Capture Processing pane render from one central source, rather than two parallel implementations. Mostly build-verifiable; verify the failure/retry paths in a live run. **Tier-2** if it touches the finalize/retry write path. | files: Views/OCRView.swift (+OCRView+*), Views/LiveCaptureView.swift, Capture/LiveCaptureProcessor.swift, new shared row/pane component | L | med
  - **Progress (2026-07-07, A1 design `.maintenance/A1-shared-pane-design.md` steps 1–9):** SHIPPED — shared `Views/Shared/{ProcessableItem,ProcessableItemRow,ProcessableItemListView,ModelChoiceView}.swift`; Files pane adopts it (`FileItem` adapter, identical render); Live pane fully adopts it (`SegmentItem` adapter, reasons + per-item retry / retry-with-model / rotate-&-re-run / view-text / reveal + grown scrollable box); `LiveCaptureProcessor.retryFailed(groupIds:override:)` generalized (G1 = all-failed footer); failure taxonomy un-conflated (`succeededNoText` for filed image-only docs — labeling only, deletion path untouched); `OCRProcessor.retryOne(...)` extracted. Builds clean, no new warnings. **Files pane inline-disclosure action UI shipped** (overnight, commit `d068a99`): tap-to-expand rows surface retry / retry-with-model / rotate-&-re-run / view-text / reclassify via `OCRProcessor.retryOne(...)` + `ModelChoiceSheet` + `FileTextViewerSheet`; review-mode keyboard/tap gestures preserved (expand only outside review mode). `.fileAsImageOnly` not surfaced (auto-files via `succeededNoText`). **REMAINING:** live-run GUI verification of the new reasons/retry paths (owner-gated).
- [x] **shipped `f1d2263`, suite-v1.2.0** — Behavior-preserving de-dups (audit `wf_4373722d-e70`): shared text-completion client; finalize/organize helpers; box/folder color-retag; small cluster (`highestLeadingNumber`, `monthTag`, `acceptedImageExtensions`, `GatewayConfig.fromDefaults`, `liveProcessingMode`); reconcile iOS(5)/Android(6) recent-years cap. | M | low
- [x] **shipped `b1fc5d4`, suite-v1.2.0** — No-API local features: processing profiles/presets + main-window global shortcuts (start / switch provider). | Views/SettingsView.swift, Views/OCRView.swift, new store | M | low
- [x] **shipped `782dfdd`, suite-v1.2.0** — Output-folder picker in the Live Capture pane (+`?` help + gray-out); unify with Process Files `outputDirectory`. **Tier-2** (output path) — add the picker + wire the EXISTING setting; don't change write/move logic. | M | low
- [x] **shipped `d2de49d`, suite-v1.2.0 (owner live-verified pairing).** **Remove the Mac Transport picker — auto-run both receivers.** The phone already chooses its transport at pairing (Wired/Wi-Fi/Cloud), so the Mac-side lan/cloud setting is redundant + a footgun (left on Cloud, Wi-Fi pairing silently dies, and vice-versa — hit live 2026-07-07). Instead: the Mac always runs the LAN `CaptureServer`, and *also* runs the Drive relay watcher automatically whenever it's signed into Google + a session is active (sign-in = the enablement, not a mode). Drop the Transport picker from `SettingsView` (keep the "Sign in to Google Drive" config); emit ONE combined pairing QR (host/port/token + relay token) so any phone-side choice works from a single scan; show dual status (Listening + Watching Drive). Gate the Drive poll to active sessions to save quota. **Tier-2** (Capture/Net/Views) — worktree + adversarial review; verify LAN via the android-ui-test-harness + the cloud path with a paired phone. | Capture/CaptureSession.swift, Views/SettingsView.swift, Views/LiveCaptureView.swift | M | low
- [x] Connectivity UX — **superseded/shipped** by the cloud-transport integration (legible Wi-Fi failure + reachability preflight landed; USB + Drive relay is now the direction). ✅

**Live-session / phone-gated (drive Live Capture — ideally a paired phone — to verify; do interactively, like the viewer bugs):**
- [x] **shipped `338dc1b`, suite-v1.2.0 (B2)** — Keep OCR/progress live while the per-segment tag card is open (looks hung today). | Views/LiveCaptureView.swift | S
- [x] Tag card: when the Spotlight tag index is still building, present UI saying so instead of silently-empty autocomplete. ✅ `SystemTagsProvider.isReady` (false until first gather) → SegmentTagCard shows a spinner + "building tag suggestions…" that clears when the query finishes. | Views/LiveCaptureView.swift (SegmentTagCard), Tagging/SystemTagsProvider.swift
- [x] After rotation review, if finalize/processing is still running, show a throbber so the gap before collection naming doesn't look hung. ✅ LiveCaptureView overlay: "Finishing — processing segments…" shown while `isFinalizing && no sheet` (the regen gap; gated off during the finalize move which has its own spinner). View-only — no Capture/ change needed. | Views/LiveCaptureView.swift
- [x] **shipped `6ea268a`, suite-v1.2.0 (B4)** — Re-pair coordination: auto re-show QR on phone re-pair; split "listening" vs "connected"; verify USBBridge re-runs `adb reverse`. | Net/, Views/LiveCaptureView.swift, companions | M
- [x] **shipped `6ea268a`, suite-v1.2.0 (B5; residual `resolvedGroupIds` resurface tracked as B9 in KNOWN_ISSUES)** — Streaming residuals (mostly shipped in the cloud-transport work — Finish drain-gate + phone queue-depth + "End segment = the only done action" landed): finish/verify any remainder — `needsResend` for P10/reclassify in-flight, `completedDocGroups` persistence across Mac restart. | Capture/LiveCaptureProcessor.swift, companions | M
- [x] **shipped `7aace39` + audit fix, suite-v1.2.0 (see KNOWN_ISSUES ✅ FIXED)** — KNOWN_ISSUES #2: merged multi-page docs leave exported originals loose — thread per-page image URLs into `organizeOutput`. **Tier-2 file-move**; needs a live pipeline run. | OCR/CollectionSegmenter.swift, Capture/LiveCaptureProcessor.swift | M

- [x] **Owner-gated: live Google Drive end-to-end test — DONE 2026-07-07.** Android phone→Drive→Mac verified end-to-end (sign-in, single photo, multi-page segment + Mac tag card, Box/Folder markers, Finish; photo durable in the Mac session + backup folder). Fixes landed: `DriveError` legibility + `DriveAuth.init` whitespace-trim; console setup (Desktop client for Mac, Android client + SHA-1 + **Custom URI scheme enabled** for the phone) captured in the Processor CLAUDE.md Live Capture section. ✅
- [x] **iOS Drive-relay on-device OAuth — implemented.** `DriveAuth.swift` (`ASWebAuthenticationSession` + PKCE, `drive.file` scope, thread-safe `TokenStore` for `DriveClient`'s blocking token provider); `CaptureViewModel` gains `TransportMode` (.lan/.drive) + auto-selects Drive when QR has a relay token and user is signed in (falls back on LAN-unreachable too); `ConnectScreen` gains a "Sign in to Google Drive" section. `project.yml` registers the reversed-client-ID URL scheme. **Placeholder client ID** — needs a real iOS OAuth client in GCP project YOUR_GCP_PROJECT (bundle ID `com.archiveprocessor.capture.ios`, "Custom URI scheme" enabled). iOS build clean, no new warnings. On-device testing deferred → `ArchiveProcessor/POTENTIAL_FEATURES.md`. | ArchiveCaptureiOS | M

## P3 — Suite structural
- [x] Processor Implementation Map added to `ArchiveProcessor/CLAUDE.md` — 2026-07-07. ✅
- [x] De-nest the `App/App` folders → `App/macOS/`. Both apps build (0 warnings), 161 Reader tests green, DMG verified. ✅
  - *(`ArchiveCore` shared-package extraction moved to `ArchiveProcessor/POTENTIAL_FEATURES.md` — deferred, 2026-07-08.)*

## Flagged — need the owner present / GUI / a scratch-corpus write
- [x] **GUI-verified 2026-07-08 (owner-driven, on the AR-Smoke scratch corpus, checked at the on-disk xattr level):** Reader inline tag-editor commit — Return-commit ✓, blur-commit of a completed token ✓. Found the half-typed-fragment case *dropped* the word (the documented no-lost-tag safety) yet left a misleading phantom chip; owner chose **WYSIWYG** instead, so `SubjectTokenField` now commits the field's tokens on blur (typed text sticks). Adds route through `TagWriter` (no tag loss); Tier-2 APPROVE. | files: Views/SubjectTokenField.swift | done
- [x] **Perf-checked the nav Table 2026-07-08 (owner-driven GUI, 40k synthetic scratch corpus): the SwiftUI `Table` JANKS at scale.** Scroll stutters; filter-box *keystrokes* lag + can beachball (per keystroke it re-filters 40k AND re-diffs the whole Table on the main thread); sort is slow. Discovery/load of 40k was fine — it's the Table view layer. At the ~150k production target this would be worse. → spawned the follow-up below.
- [x] **Reader: swap the nav SwiftUI `Table` → AppKit `NSTableView`** — `AppKitTableView.swift` (`NSViewRepresentable` wrapping `NSScrollView`+`NSTableView` with `NSTableViewDiffableDataSource`): virtualized rows + cell reuse (fixes scroll); incremental snapshot apply (fixes sort); debounced `filterSearchText` (150 ms, fixes the typing beachball). `ContextMenuTableView` subclass for right-click menu; `ContextMenuActions` trampoline bridges NSMenu items to `NavigationModel`. Model + `TagWriter` untouched (no data-safety surface). Build clean, 161 tests green. **Full GUI re-verify deferred → Morning Review (owner-gated).** ✅
- [x] Remove stray `InlineTest` tag on the SCRATCH corpus — **N/A: scratch corpus (`AR-Smoke/Batch-A/00001`) no longer exists on disk** (directory empty, file cleaned up). No action needed. ✅

## Excluded (not "now": need cost / owner accounts)
- Processor Tier-1 `test-smoke.sh` / Tier-2 `test-tier2.sh` (real OCR → keys + API cost); Processor App-Store/Play Phase 4 (owner accounts/assets); Reader cloud-drive support; Reader creation-date-mirror (would write metadata onto the real corpus).
  - [x] **G5 — cheap Tier-1 smoke gate shipped (2026-07-07).** New Suite-root `./test-smoke.sh processor|reader|all` (mirrors `launch.sh`) → `ArchiveReader/test-smoke.sh` (build + full unit suite, **135 tests, free**) + `ArchiveProcessor/test-smoke.sh` (headless **2-image** OCR via `ProcessFilesTestDriver`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, ~a few cents, `mktemp` scratch-isolated, key never printed). Distinct from the cost-heavy `scripts/test-smoke.sh` (raw per-provider calls) + `scripts/test-tier2.sh` (multi-case pipeline) above. Both verified PASS. ✅
